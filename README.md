# Supervised Learning on Classification

## Task
Using a dataset with 48,000 entries and 400+ variables to predict answers to the question "How important is religion in your life?" 

## Results
- Fine-tuned XGBoost and neural network models to predict responses to the question, ‘How important is religion in your life?’; explored model stacking.
- Preprocessed data using variable standardization, one-hot encoding, etc. 
- Fine-tuned a random forest model to identify key predictive features.


## Side Notes
- This was a team project (team of 3)
- Code need further organization

# Supervised-Learning-on-Classification
using a dataset on a dataset with 48,000 entries and 400+ variables to predict answers to the question "How important is religion in your life?" using various supervised machine learning algorithms

- Fine-tuned XGBoost and neural network models to predict responses to the question, ‘How important is religion in your life?’; explored model stacking.
- Preprocessed data using variable standardization, one-hot encoding, etc. 
- Fine-tuned a random forest model to identify key predictive features.
